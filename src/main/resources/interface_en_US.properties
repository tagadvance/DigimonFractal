Synopsis: While watching Digimon, some code briefly appeared on screen in episode 5, "Kabuterimon's Electro Shocker". \
Being the curious individual that I am, I wanted to know what it did. \
Apparently <a href="http://digitalworldproblems.tumblr.com/post/76036641581/while-im-looking-at-that-moviecode-post-he">other people have had the same inclination</a>; \
however, the images they had posted were long since dead. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140626005307/http://digitalworldproblems.tumblr.com/post/76036641581/while-im-looking-at-that-moviecode-post-he">The Wayback Machine</a> was of little help.\
A little perturbed, I decided to port the code to Java. This program is the result.<br>\
